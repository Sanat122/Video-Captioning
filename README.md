# Real-Time Video Captioning with Django

**Introduction:**
Visio Text is a real-time video captioning project that leverages the capabilities of artificial intelligence to provide dynamic text captions for videos. This innovative solution empowers users to experience automated and customizable captions while watching videos on platforms such as Netflix or YouTube. Specifically designed to address the needs of individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing, Visio Text enhances accessibility and inclusivity in the digital era.

**Project Structure:**
The project repository includes the following directories and files:

- **videocaptioningUI**: User interface components for video captioning.
- **AML_2404_Video_Captioning.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook file related to the real-time video captioning process.
- **captions.txt**: Text file storing captions for videos.
- **requirements.txt**: File specifying project dependencies.

**Getting Started:**
To set up the project locally and run the Django application for real-time video captioning:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run the Django application using the command `python manage.py runserver`.
5. Access the video captioning service at [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) in your web browser.

**Usage:**
Once the project is set up, integrate the video captioning service into your Django application. Ensure that video files are appropriately linked, and the AI-driven captioning will provide real-time subtitles during video playback.

**Contribution Guidelines:**
If you wish to contribute to the project, please follow the guidelines outlined in the CONTRIBUTING.md file (if available). Submit bug reports, feature requests, or pull requests to help improve the project and enhance real-time video captioning capabilities.
